# Windows 8.12 Crying Edition
Yes. This is real. Please forgive me for making this.

## Compiling

It is not the easiest to compile, in fact, I don't even know how to compile this.

Until I can figure out how to compile, or somebody tells me how, you'll just have to download the ISO image and the boot disks.

Sorry about that.
